# ZeroMQ_SDK_for_JAVA
In the SDK folder you will find the basic service abstract class. In this class we define how, when and what type of ZMQ 
socket is used for assuring the communication between different microservices. Using this SDK we can have both Publish/Subscribe
communication model using PUB/SUB sockets and Request/response model using DEALER/ROUTER sockets.
